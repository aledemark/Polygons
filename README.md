# Polygon Interface
This library consent,using the polymorphism, to create polygons objects (base class), in particular rectangle, rhombus and right triangle (derived class), but it can be expanded with 
more polygons. It consents also to calculate perimeter and area of the polygons, and potentially to draw them.
